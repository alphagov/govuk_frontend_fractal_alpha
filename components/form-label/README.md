# Usability

All form fields should be given labels.

Mark the labels of optional fields with '(optional)'.

Don't mark mandatory fields with asterisks.

Don't hide labels, unless the surrounding context makes them unnecessary.

Labels should be aligned above their fields.

Label text should be short, direct and in sentence case.

Avoid colons at the end of labels.

Labels should be associated with form fields using the for attribute.

## Hint text

Don't use placeholder text in form fields, as this will disappear once content is entered into the form field.

Use hint text for supporting contextual help, this will always be shown.

Hint text should sit above a form field.

Ensure hint text can be read correctly by screen readers.
