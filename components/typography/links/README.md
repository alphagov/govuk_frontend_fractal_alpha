# Notes

* links within body copy should be blue and underlined
* links without surrounding text should not have a full stop at the end
* link colours can be found in the colour palette

## External links

* avoid 'external link' icons as they're not well recognised
* first establish if there's a genuine need to know that the link is to an external site
* if there is, use language to make it clear that this is the case
