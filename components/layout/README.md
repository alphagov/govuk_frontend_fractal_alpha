# Notes

## Page width

The default maximum page width is 1020px, but go wider if the content requires it.

Use a grid to lay out your content. To prevent long lines of text, content should sit in a column which is two-thirds of the page width.

Long lines reduce legibility, so all lines of text should be no longer than 70 to 80 characters.

## Screen size

Design for small screens first using a single column layout.

Optimise for different screen sizes, but donâ€™t make assumptions about what devices people are using.

## Spacing

* spacing between elements is usually 5px, 10px, 15px or multiples of 15px
* gutters are 15px for smaller screens and 30px for larger screens
