# Notes

* all form fields should be given labels
* mark the labels of optional fields with '(optional)'
* don't mark mandatory fields with asterisks
* don't hide labels unless the surrounding context makes them unnecessary
* labels should be aligned above their fields
* label text should be short, direct and in sentence case
* avoid colons at the end of labels
* labels should be associated with form fields using the `for` attribute

## Hint text

* don't use placeholder text in form fields, as this will disappear once content is entered into the form field
* use hint text for supporting contextual help, this will always be shown
* hint text should sit above a form field
* ensure hint text can be read correctly by screen readers
