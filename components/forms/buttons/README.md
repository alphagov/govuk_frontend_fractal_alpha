# Notes

* use buttons to move though a transaction
* aim to use only one button per page
* button text should be short and describe the action the button performs


## Start now button

Launch your service with a Start now button.


## Disabled buttons

* don’t disable buttons, unless there’s a good reason to
* if you have to disable buttons, make sure they look like you can't click them (use 50% opacity)
* an example of a useful disabled option is a calendar with greyed out days where no bookings are available
* provide another way for the user to continue, add an error message or text to explain why the button is disabled
